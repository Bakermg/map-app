# Project: Neighborhood Map
---

This is the final project of the Ucacity FEND Nanodegree. The challenge is to build a neighborhood map,
using Google Map API, and another API of choice while using Knockout.js framework. 
For this project I choose Flickr to show imagesof the selected markers on the map. 
My map is a guide to show some of the points of interest of Broward County Florida. 
You can find the airport, shopping, foods, and parks in the area that are the best around. 
Just open the map and click on one of the marker for a look at what is there.
